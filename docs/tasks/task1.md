## 📁 Task 1: Providing Context

### 🔹 Section 1: Fail & Tagging Techniques
- [ ] Run `yarn test` to generate some output
- [ ] Add a terminal to context using `@terminal` or by name (e.g. `@myTerminal`)
- [ ] Add context by dragging a folder or tagging it (e.g. `@/my-folder`)
- [ ] Ask Cursor to fix the issue
- [ ] Instead of rerunning the test manually, **tag the terminal** to verify the fix

- ⏳ Waiting for others?
  - Change the test, so the watch will fail and check if chat catches it without tagging again
  - Explore the difference between `/add active` and `/add open editors`

### 🔹 Section 2: Git & Context Tricks
- [ ] Use `@git` to generate a PR description
  Example prompt: `@commit write PR description, send it as markdown snippet`

- ⏳ Waiting for others?
  - try to ask for code review
  - read prompts in folder: docs/custom-mode-prompts
