# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Step Wizard Form

## Overview
Transform the existing single-page UserForm component into a multi-step wizard interface that guides users through the registration process in a more structured and user-friendly manner.

## Problem Statement
The current UserForm displays all fields on a single page, which can be overwhelming for users and doesn't provide a sense of progress. A multi-step wizard will improve user experience by breaking down the form into logical sections and showing clear progression.

## Goals
- Improve user experience by reducing cognitive load
- Increase form completion rates
- Provide clear visual progress indication
- Maintain form state across steps
- Enable easy navigation between steps

## User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to see my progress through the form so that I know how many steps remain
2. **As a user**, I want to navigate back to previous steps to review or modify my answers
3. **As a user**, I want my data preserved when moving between steps
4. **As a user**, I want clear indication of which fields are required before proceeding
